# Appetizers
A simple appetizer ordering app built using Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode.

- The app has a Home Screen where the user can view a list of all the appetizers. The user can click on an appetizer item to view its details and add it to the order.
- The account screen will allow the user to enter their personal info and select other order preferences and save those changes.
- The order screen will have the appetizers added to the order. The user can also delete any appetizer by swiping the item to the left and clicking on the delete button.

Through this project, I have learnt about the details of working with data in a declarative UI framework like SwiftUI, about List View, Network Management, Errors and alerts,
Validations, @AppStorage, @Published, @StateObject, @FocusState, @EnvironmentObject, Async/Await Network calls, and more and leveraged best practices with ViewModels, StateObjects,
Bindings, making components more reusable.
